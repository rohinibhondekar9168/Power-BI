# Weather Forecasting Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of weather data spanning from 2014 to 2024, focusing on various Indian cities. The primary objective is to uncover trends and patterns in weather data to enhance forecasting accuracy and support data-driven decision-making in sectors such as agriculture, construction, and transportation.

## Features

- **Data Range**: The dataset covers weather information from 2014 to 2024.
- **Slicers**: Two slicers at the top of the dashboard for:
  - Filtering data by date, month, and year.
  - Selecting different cities to view weather information.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Average Temperature
  - Average Humidity
  - Total Precipitation
  - Average Wind Speed
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Line Chart**: Displays maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures by year and month.
  - **Clustered Bar Chart**: Shows average humidity of Ludhiana, Mumbai, and Pune by year.
  - **Line Chart**: Illustrates maximum temperature trends by year.
  - **Donut Chart**: Presents the percentage distribution of maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures.
  - **Gauge**: Indicates average wind speed.
  - **Line and Stacked Column Chart**: Combines average pressure (column) and average humidity (line) by year and quarter.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:
- To analyze historical weather data and identify significant trends and patterns.
